"""Shared pytest setup for the whole test suite.

pytest loads conftest.py files before it collects (imports) any test
module in the same directory - that ordering is what makes the env var
below actually work. app/storage.py reads UPLOAD_DIR from the
environment exactly once, at import time, to build its UPLOAD_DIR
constant. If this were set inside a fixture function instead of here
at module level, it would run too late: by the time any fixture
actually executes, every test file (and therefore app.storage, via
`from app.main import app`) has typically already been imported during
collection, so the constant would already be frozen to the real
"uploads" default.

# its own file-cleanup logic anymore - nothing here can leak into real
# data, and the whole temp folder just gets deleted once, below, after
# the entire suite finishes.
